## üöÄ Inspiration


Road trips are all about adventure, but planning one can be overwhelming. We wanted to build a tool that makes it effortless to plan a perfect road trip by handling routing, discovering nearby attractions, creating a Spotify playlist, and even generating a smart packing list. Our goal was to create a seamless travel companion that combines AI-powered recommendations with real-time data to enhance every journey.

- **AI-Powered Packing List:** Generates a personalized packing list based on location, weather, and trip details.
- **Custom Spotify Playlist:** Suggests a road trip playlist based on popular regional genres.
- **Interactive Bingo Game:** A fun way to engage passengers during the trip.
